    <p>
        Programming is a process that leads from an original formulation of a computing problem to executable computer programs. Programming involves activities such as: analysis, understanding, generating algorithms, verification of algorithms including their correctness and resources consumption, and implementation (commonly referred to as coding) of algorithms in a target programming language. Source code is written in a programming language that expresses the algorithm. Perhaps the earliest description of programming is from Ada Lovelace in the 19th century describing Babbage's Analytical Engine. Early code was specialized to its hardware often using machine language. As new programming languages evolved code became more portable and expressive. In the 1970s structured programming emerged as an influential way to improve the quality, clarity, and development time of computer programs.

        The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate performing a specific task or solving a given problem. The process of programming thus requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

        Tasks accompanying programming include: testing, debugging, source code maintenance, implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process with programming, implementation, or coding as a part. Software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices. Reverse engineering is a related process of analyzing and decoding existing programs.
